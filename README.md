## Learning Competencies
- Further your understanding of how and when to use:
    - Variables
    - Arrays 
    - Functions
    - Loops
    - Conditional Statements
    - Event Listeners
- Create multiple small functions
- Debug code you have written
- Practice working with more complex algorithms
- Know when to ask for help, and don't stay stuck for too long 

## Summary

Today we're going to build an all time classic game! All the coding practice you have done so far in sprints 3 and 4 has been fairly on the rails, so in this challenge we're going to give you a blank page and more freedom to tackle the problem in your own way. This is an exercise in problem solving and algorithmic thinking. The README will provide step by step instructions for _a_ possible solution.. but! As always with programming, there are a million different ways you could build Tic Tac Toe. If you have a little programming experience already and want to go off the beaten path to solve this challenge- go for it. 

## See it in action

If somehow you have made it this far in life without encountering Tic Tac Toe (AKA Noughts and Crosses), you can check it out [here](https://playtictactoe.org/).

## Timebox

Challenge | Time|
------------|----------|
Tic Tac Toe | 10-15 hours
Reflect | 20 minutes

## Let's do it!

1. Create a fork of the <go to='https://github.com/dev-academy-challenges/tic-tac-toe'>tic-tac-toe repo</go>

2. Clone your copy of the forked repository down using `git clone https://github.com/your-name/tic-tac-toe` (replacing your-name with your GitHub account name.)

3. Navigate into the tic-tac-toe directory and open it in your code editor. You'll see a CSS file, a JavaScript file, and an HTML file.
