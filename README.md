## Learning Competencies
- Further your understanding of how and when to use:
    - Variables
    - Arrays 
    - Functions
    - Loops
    - Conditional Statements
    - Event Listeners
- Create multiple small functions
- Debug code you have written
- Practice working with more complex algorithms
- Know when to ask for help, and don't stay stuck for too long 

## Summary

Today we're going to build an all time classic game! All the coding practice you have done so far in sprints 3 and 4 has been fairly on the rails, so in this challenge we're going to give you a blank page and more freedom to tackle the problem in your own way. This is an exercise in problem solving and algorithmic thinking. The README will provide step by step instructions for _a_ possible solution.. but! As always with programming, there are a million different ways you could build Tic Tac Toe. If you have a little programming experience already and want to go off the beaten path to solve this challenge- go for it. 

## See it in action

If somehow you have made it this far in life without encountering Tic Tac Toe (AKA Noughts and Crosses), you can check it out [here](https://playtictactoe.org/).

## Timebox

Challenge | Time|
------------|----------|
Tic Tac Toe | 10-15 hours
Reflect | 20 minutes

## Set up

1. Create a fork of the <go to='https://github.com/dev-academy-challenges/tic-tac-toe'>tic-tac-toe repo</go>

2. Clone your copy of the forked repository down using `git clone https://github.com/your-name/tic-tac-toe` (replacing your-name with your GitHub account name.)

3. Navigate into the tic-tac-toe directory and open it in your code editor. You'll see a CSS file, a JavaScript file, and an HTML file. The only thing we've done is create the board using an HTML table and add a little bit of styling to get it looking pretty. The Javascript is all you!

## Let's do it!

Here is an overview of things that the finished Tic Tac Toe game will need. We'll tackle them one by one. 

- An array containing all the squares on the board. We'll need this to get the Xs and Os displaying on the page, and also to check and see if anyone has won. 
- The ability to click the squares (which are HTML `TD` elements) and put either an X or an O into them. 
- A boolean to keep track of whose turn it is, X or O, and logic to switch turns once a player makes a move.   
- A way to display whose turn it is at the top of the page.
- A function for checking to see if anyone has won. IE, the same symbol 3 times horizontally, vertically or diagonally. (This is the hard bit).
- Logic to display "___ WON!" at the top of the page when someone wins. 

## The array of cells



## Stretch ideas

* Create a function that checks for a 'Stalemate'. IE, all the squares are full and nobody won. Display "STALEMATE" at the top of the page. 
* A restart button, that resets the game. 
* Wacky cartoon sound effects.
* A tally that keeps track of how many times X or O has won.
* A new mechanic that makes tic tac toe more interesting to play. (It's a pretty boring game).
* Turn it into an NFT for some reason! Don't worry- they're _totally_ not a predatory Ponzi scheme.
